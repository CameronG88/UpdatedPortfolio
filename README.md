# Cams Portfolio

This is my initial web developer portfolio after about 3 months experience coding. I used a Gatsby starter as the base for the site and if you would like to do the same head to https://www.gatsbyjs.com/ to get started and then follow the installation below.

## Installation

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
<br/>
`gatsby new gatsby-starter-dimension https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-dimension`

Run `gatsby develop` in the terminal to start the dev site.
